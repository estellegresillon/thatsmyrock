Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it spent 27 weeks at number one on the UK Albums Chart and 15 weeks at number one in the US. It was lauded by critics for its innovations in production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for providing a musical representation of its generation and the contemporary counterculture. It won four Grammy Awards in 1968, including Album of the Year, the first rock LP to receive this honour.;12047960;

Having until then recorded mostly acoustic music, Dylan used rock musicians as his backing band on every track of the album, except for the closing track, the 11-minute ballad ""Desolation Row"". Critics have focused on the innovative way Dylan combined driving, blues-based music with the subtlety of poetry to create songs that captured the political and cultural chaos of contemporary America. Author Michael Gray has argued that, in an important sense, the 1960s ""started"" with this album.";1329897;

The album's diverse sounds include tape loops and backwards recordings on the psychedelic ""Tomorrow Never Knows"", a classical string octet on ""Eleanor Rigby"", and Indian-music backing on ""Love You To"". The album was reduced to eleven songs by Capitol Records in North America, where three of its tracks instead appeared on the June 1966 release Yesterday and Today.";12047948;

By January 1992, it had replaced Michael Jackson's album Dangerous at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album also produced three other successful singles: ""Come as You Are"", ""Lithium"", and ""In Bloom"". The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) has certified the album Diamond (at least 10 million copies shipped), and it has sold at least 30 million copies worldwide, with 10,640,000 sold in the United States.
Nevermind was in part responsible for bringing both alternative rock and grunge to a mainstream audience. It has been ranked highly on lists of the greatest albums of all time by publications such as Rolling Stone and Time.";1262014;

After the band's previous album Led Zeppelin III received lukewarm reviews from critics, they decided their fourth album would officially be untitled. This, along with the inner sleeve's design featuring four symbols that represented each band member, led to the album being referred to variously as the Four Symbols logo, Four Symbols, The Fourth Album, Untitled, Runes, The Hermit, and ZoSo (which was derived from Page's symbol).In addition to lacking an album title, the cover featured no band name, as the group wished to be anonymous and to avoid easy pigeonholing by the press.";11591214;

It developed from the aborted Lifehouse project, a multi-media rock opera written by the group's Pete Townshend as a follow-up to the band's 1969 album Tommy. The project was cancelled due to its complexity and conflicts with Kit Lambert, the band's manager, but Townshend was persuaded to record the songs as a straightforward studio album.

The Who recorded Who's Next with assistance from recording engineer Glyn Johns. After producing the song ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" in the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio, they relocated to Olympic Studios to record and mix most of the album's remaining songs. They made prominent use of the synthesizer on the album, particularly on ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and ""Baba O'Riley"", which were both released as singles. The cover photo was shot by Ethan Russell and made reference to the monolith in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey, as it featured group members having urinated against a concrete piling protruding from a slag heap.

Who's Next was an immediate success when it was released in August 1971. It has since been viewed by many critics as the Who's best record and one of the greatest albums of all time. It was reissued on CD several times with additional songs originally intended for Lifehouse.";213380;

Recording sessions took place from April to November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, with a production budget of $750,000. Quincy Jones produced the album and Jackson wrote four of its nine songs.

In just over a year, Thriller became—and currently remains—the world's best-selling album, with estimated sales of 66 million copies.[3][nb 1] It is the best-selling album in the United States and the first album to be certified 33× multi-platinum, having shipped 33 million album-equivalent units.[9] The album won a record-breaking eight Grammy Awards in 1984, including Album of the Year. It produced seven singles—""The Girl Is Mine"", ""Billie Jean"", ""Beat It"", ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"", ""Human Nature"", ""P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)"", and ""Thriller""—all of which reached the top 10 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. Thriller broke racial barriers in pop music, enabling Jackson's appearances on MTV and meeting with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. The album was one of the first to use music videos as successful promotional tools, and the videos for the songs ""Thriller"", ""Billie Jean"", and ""Beat It"" all received regular rotation on MTV.";96126;

In contrast to the ambient experimentation of their 1984 release, The Unforgettable Fire, the band aimed for a harder-hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures on The Joshua Tree. The album is influenced by American and Irish roots music, and through sociopolitically conscious lyrics embellished with spiritual imagery, it contrasts the group's antipathy for the ""real America"" with their fascination with the ""mythical America"".";104260;

What's Going On was the first Marvin Gaye album for which Gaye is credited as producer and Motown Records' main studio band, the session musicians known as the Funk Brothers, received a credit.

What's Going On is a concept album consisting of nine songs, most of which segue into the next. It has been categorized as a song cycle; the album ends with a reprise of the album's opening theme. The story is told from the point of view of a Vietnam veteran returning to the country he had been fighting for, and seeing only hatred, suffering, and injustice.

The Beatles;21;Rubber soul;1960;1965;Rock;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_Soul;rubber-soul-the-beatles.jpg;;"Rubber Soul is the sixth studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 3 December 1965 in the United Kingdom, on EMI's Parlophone label, accompanied by the non-album double A-side single ""Day Tripper"" / ""We Can Work It Out"". The original North American version of the album was altered by Capitol Records to include a different selection of tracks. Rubber Soul met with a highly favourable critical response and topped record charts in Britain and the United States for several weeks.

Often referred to as a folk rock album, Rubber Soul incorporates a mix of pop, soul and folk musical styles. The title derives from the colloquialism ""plastic soul"", which referred to soul music played by English instead of African-American musicians. After the British version of A Hard Day's Night, it was the second Beatles LP to contain only original material. For the first time in their career, the band were able to record the album over a continuous period, uninterrupted by touring commitments. The songs demonstrate the Beatles' increasing maturity as lyricists and, in their incorporation of brighter guitar tones and new instrumentation such as harmonium, sitar and fuzz bass, the group striving for more expressive sounds and arrangements for their music. The project marked a progression in the band's treatment of the album format as an artistic platform, an approach they continued to develop with Revolver and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The North American version of Rubber Soul contained ten of the fourteen new songs, supplemented by two tracks withheld from the band's Help! album. The four songs omitted by Capitol, including the February 1966 single ""Nowhere Man"", later appeared on the June 1966 North American-only release Yesterday and Today.";12047936;

Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—""One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)"". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.

Blonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called ""a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial"". It was one of the first double albums in rock music.";1400030;

Fields agreed and convinced Craig Leon to produce Ramones, and the band recorded a demo for prospective record labels. Leon persuaded Sire president Seymour Stein to listen to the band perform, and he later offered the band a recording contract. The Ramones began recording in January 1976, needing only seven days and $6,400 to record the album. They used similar sound-output techniques to those of the Beatles and used advanced production methods by Leon.

The album cover, photographed by Punk magazine's Roberta Bayley, features the four members leaning against a brick wall in New York City. The record company paid only $125 for the front photo, which has since become one of the most imitated album covers of all time. The back cover depicts an eagle belt buckle along with the album's liner notes. After its release, Ramones was promoted with two singles which failed to chart.

The band would go on to feature a rotating lineup of many musicians, including Eric Clapton, Klaus Voormann, Alan White, Billy Preston, Jim Keltner, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, and Lennon's former Beatles bandmates George Harrison and Ringo Starr. After the Lennons' move to New York, they began collaborating with Elephant's Memory, under the moniker of the ""Plastic Ono Elephant's Memory Band"". Lennon's collaborations continued under similar names, until the winding down of the concept in 1974.

Since 2009 (following the death of Lennon in 1980), Ono and her son Sean Lennon have led a new incarnation of the group, known as the Yoko Ono Plastic Ono Band, which has engaged in many new activities.";660856;

The album features nine songs, two of which were written and composed by Peter Tosh and the remaining seven of which were written and composed by Bob Marley.

As his effort to break into the mainstream, the album was a commercial success, peaking at number three on the Billboard 200 and eventually selling six million copies in the United States. Two singles were released from the album: ""Born to Run"" and ""Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out""; the first helped Springsteen to reach mainstream popularity. The tracks ""Thunder Road"", ""She's the One"", and ""Jungleland"" became staples of album-oriented rock radio and Springsteen concert high points.

Born to Run garnered widespread acclaim when it was first released on August 25, 1975, by Columbia Records. It has since been considered by critics to be one of the greatest albums in popular music. On November 14, 2005, a 30th Anniversary remaster of the album was released as a box set including two DVDs: a production diary film and a concert movie.

The album was remastered again in 2014 by veteran mastering engineer Bob Ludwig, who has worked on much of Springsteen's audio output since 1982, for release as part of The Album Collection Vol. 1 1973–1984, a boxed set composed of remastered editions of his first seven albums.

The album marked Dylan's return to Columbia Records after a two-album stint with Asylum Records. Dylan commenced recording the album in New York City in September 1974. In December, shortly before Columbia was due to release the record, Dylan abruptly re-recorded much of the material in a studio in Minneapolis. The final album contains five tracks from New York and five from Minneapolis.

Blood on the Tracks was initially received with mixed reviews, but has subsequently been acclaimed as one of Dylan's greatest albums by critics and fans. The songs have been linked to tensions in Dylan's personal life, including estrangement from his then-wife Sara. One of their children, Jakob Dylan, has described the songs as ""my parents talking"". The album has been viewed as an outstanding example of the confessional singer-songwriter's craft, and it has been called ""the truest, most honest account of a love affair from tip to stern ever put down on magnetic tape"". In interviews, Dylan has denied that the songs on the album are autobiographical. In 2003, the album was ranked  No.  16 on Rolling Stone's list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, and in 2004, it was placed at  No.  5 on Pitchfork's list of the top 100 albums of the 1970s.";1399868;
